            <h2>Artificial Intelligence for 2048</h2>
            <h4>An approach to beat 2048 with AI</h4>
            <h5>By Jennifer Schürch & Yves Lütjens</h5>
            <p>The game 2048 is a hard game to beat. As there are many random variables during play, one has a hard time to implement a good algorithm for it.
            We started of by implemented a heuristic algorithm and set the aim that it can reach 10'000 points in average.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Heuristic</h4>
            <p>Our first approach consisted of creating an algorithm which moved alternately down and right and as soon as he was stuck trying to find if the
              bottom row or the lefthand row was full and move in that direction if one was indeed. The idea behind that was to keep the highest tile in the bottom right corner.
              After a short time we realised that this strategy will not bear fruits as it's average score was around 3'500, so we discarded our algorithm and started over.
              This time we made an algorithm that will make two steps in the future in every possible direction (ignoring the random tile spawn) and assessed the board at that stage. We valued the board
              by a score which was strongly depending on the position of the tiles. The better a tile was positioned, the higher the factor it's value was multiplied with.
              A good position was the closenes to the bottom right corner, and the tile in the corner itself got a hefty bonus
              to force the algorithm to keep the highest value there. These improvements got us way closer to our aim, overall the algorithm scored an average of 7'000 points.<br>
              We further improved it by giving a neighbourbonus for tiles of the same value, and weighted empty tiles too, so the algorithm had more interest in merging tiles.
              This small tweaks finally pushed our algorithm slightly over the 10'000 points threshold.
            </p>
            <h4>Expectimax</h4>
            <p>As 2048 contains a random factor in regard of the randomly spawned 2 or 4 value tile, Expectimax is the most obvious approach to implement an AI.
              We used the heuristics score function to value the board, as well as an adaptive depth going from depth one to depth three depending on the number of empty tiles.
              This allowed us to speed up the early phase of the game, as depth 3 with our score function needed up to 10 seconds for a move, depending on the number of empty tiles after a move.
              As we urged for more speed, we also implemented multiproccessing into our AI that created a process for each top level move, in order to speed it up further.
              Thanks to the two mentioned measurements we achieved an average time per move of under one second.
