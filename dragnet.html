            <h2>Solving Sudoku with CSP and creating a dragnet with Datalog</h2>
            <!--<h4 class="subtitle">An approach to beat 2048 with AI</h4>-->
            <h5>By Jennifer Schürch & Yves Lütjens</h5>
            <h3>Sudoku</h3>
            <p>Writing a programm to solve any possible Sudoku riddle can rather easely be done using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">Constraint Satisfaction Problem</a>.
              By adding only a few constraints one can solve a Sudoku in no time. We created two different approaches and let them run against each other.</p>

            <h4>Domain Adaption</h4>
            <p>In this approach we focused on the adaption of the domain, which means that we only added the all different constraints that each number can
              only occure once. To insert the existing variables we restricted the domain of the field to the given number.
            </p>

            <h4>Constraint Addition</h4>
            <p>In contrary to the solution that has been discussed before, in this approach we add another constraint instead of reducing the domain for existing nubmers.
            this constraint consits of a lambda function which is added to each predefined variable and limits it's assignment to the given number.</p>
            <h4>Comparison</h4>
            <table>
                <caption>Average Time over 10'000 iterations</caption>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Approach</th>
                        <th>Average Time per Game [s]</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Domain Adaption</td>
                        <td>0.01889</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Constraint Addition</td>
                        <td>0.01762</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>The table above indicates, that the approach with the Domain Adaption is a bit slower than the Constraint Addition.
              Even if the difference is in the range of 0.001 seconds it is clear that even such a small change can influence the performance significantly.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Dragnet</h3>
            <p>To create a dragnet using Datalog is a challenge! We have taken it up and created a dragnet to analyse calls and texts between persons of a company.
              In this part of the blog we will go into depth how our dragnet works and explain what which code-element does.

            <p>These improvements got us way closer to our aim, overall the algorithm scored an average of 7'000 points.<br>
                We further improved it by giving a neighbourbonus which we had in the Check Score algorithm, for tiles of the same value and weighted empty tiles too, so the algorithm had more interest in merging tiles.
                This small tweaks finally pushed our algorithm slightly over the 10'000 points threshold.<br>
                The following graphs show how the different heuristic algorithms did perform over 200 games and how they perform against the given random agent.

            <h4>Expectimax</h4>
            <p>As 2048 contains a random factor in regard of the randomly spawned 2 or 4 value tile, Expectimax is the most obvious approach to implement an AI.
                We used the Hierarchicals heuristics score function (called Heuristic in the following) to value the board, as well as an adaptive depth going from depth one to depth three depending on the number of empty tiles.
                This allowed us to speed up the early phase of the game, as depth 3 with our score function needed up to 20 seconds for a move, depending on the number of empty tiles after a move.
                As we urged for more speed, we also implemented multiprocessing into our AI that created a process for each top level move, in order to speed it up further.
                Thanks to the two mentioned measurements we achieved an average time per move of under one second.
                Overall the first iteration of our AI did alot better than the heuristic, it regularly won the game and the average score increased to 30'000 points.
                It was a good first step but we wanted to do better!<br>
                The next thing we tried was implementing a bonus if the neighbour was half as big, so that the AI can merge more smoothly. In contrary to what we expected,
                this measurement destroyed the algorithm and scored lower than the heuristic. We came up with the idea to distribute the factors like a snake and give the corner a hefty bonus, according to the following image:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img class="article-image-rect" src="images/blogs/ai/board_bonus_searchai_heuristic.jpg" alt="Bonus distribution second iteration">
                <figcaption>Bonus distribution Improved Heuristic</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The results showed further improvement in the average score up to 44'000 points. The problem was that the algorithm still did not stack the tiles in a perfect descending order.
                Sometimes small numbers where caught in the bottom left corner which disturbed the system and lead to big problems after the 4096 tile has been reached. Therefore we came up with the Snakey variation of the heuristic
                score system. In the Snakey variation we generated an array of big numbers with great distances between each other and in a descending order that would force the AI to fill up all the ranks in the bottom rows.
                This approach finally was the breakthrough we where looking for!<br>
                With an average score of 90'000 points it exceeded all previous implementations we made by far.
                Furthermore this variant was alot faster than previous iterations as it only needs to make one
                matrix multiplication instead of two for loops and multiple if statements.<br>
                We tested out multiple other distributions, which we thought could work well with the same system as the Snakey.
                One was a diagonal decreasing distribution of the bonuses, another one was squares, and the last one was Snakey+ which also had a neighbourbonus implemented.
                At the end Snakey still was the most succesfull variation we created and if we wanted to improve it it just got worse.
                The score distribution for the different versions looked as follows:

                <p>The following two graphs show how the score and the tiles have been distributed over 20 games. As one can see, is the Snakey scoring function
                    mostly in the range between 60'000 to 80'000 points, which means that he often fails just before merging to the 8192. Whereas the Diagonal scoring function seems to have
                    less problems merging to the 8192 tile when it even comes as far as the 4096 tile. This leads to the conclusion that in the Diagonal function the distribution of tiles
                    seems to be better when the board is loaded with high tiles.
                    A next step could be to combine the Snakey and Diagonal function, that the Snakey handles the part until the 4096 tile and then the Diagonal function takes over to reach an even higher score.

                    <p>As a last step we analysed the speed of our AI and how much multiprocessing speeded the calculation up for different depths.
                        We started always from the same board as seen on the graphic below and made three moves with every variation.
                        The variations reached from depth one to depth five and once with multiprocessing enabled and once without.
                        We calculated the average time per move and compared them to each other.<br>
                        In conclusion we saw that multiprocessing is already a bit faster at depth one and nearly double as fast at depth two.
                        As expected the performance boost increased quickly and at depth five multiprocessing was already four times faster than singleproccessing.
